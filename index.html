<h3 id="link-to-biography">Biography</h3>

  <p>I am an experienced communications and marketing professional who has worked in higher education in both the 
	UK and the US for the past 8 years. I currently work at UCL School of Management as a Digital Communications Officer. 
	Outside of work, I can be found on long walks in the countryside and socialising with friends. 

	I graduated from Swansea University in the UK in 2017 and then studied a Master's degree in the US at the University 
	of New Mexico. I moved back to the UK and now work in London in communications and marketing, where I have travelled 
	extensively for work. Last year, I travelled to Tokyo, South Korea, India and Dubai where I had the opportunity to
	meet prosecptive students at UCL.

	 I am passionate about travel, animals and living a healthy, active lifestyle. I also enjoy reading, playing chess, 
	 and of course - learning to code.
